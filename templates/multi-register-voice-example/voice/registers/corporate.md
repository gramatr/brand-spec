# Voice — corporate register (primary)

> **Sample file.** Replace with your brand's actual corporate voice.
> Delete this callout when you do.

## Core Characterization

The voice the public hears. Confident, direct, and respectful of the
reader's time. Speaks to "you" — the prospect, customer, or reader.

## Voice Attributes

- Confident without bravado
- Specific over abstract
- Short sentences. Concrete nouns.
- Honest about tradeoffs

## What the Voice Is NOT

(Primary-register canonical section. Secondary registers replace this
with two inheritance-aware sections — see `engineering.md`.)

- Not breezy or chatty
- Not corporate-bland ("synergy," "leverage," "robust")
- Not jargon-heavy

## Tone Rules

- Lead with the reader's outcome, not the product's feature.
- One idea per paragraph.
- Numbers beat adjectives.

## What does NOT fit this register

(v1.3, issue #8 item 9.) Drift-detection negative-space documentation.
Examples of content that looks corporate but is not:

- Imperative-to-the-reader code instructions ("Run X.") — that is
  `engineering`, not `corporate`.
- Internal Slack-tone shorthand or emoji-as-bullet — that is internal
  voice, not customer-facing.
- Product-marketing hype ("revolutionary," "best-in-class") — forbidden
  brand-wide; never on-register here.

If a generation request asks for one of these shapes, switch register
or push back on the brief.
